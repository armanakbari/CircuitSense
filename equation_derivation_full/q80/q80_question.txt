Task: Derive the transfer function from V1 to R4.

Please provide a complete step-by-step derivation showing:
1. The circuit analysis method used (nodal analysis, mesh analysis, etc.)
2. All intermediate equations
3. The algebraic manipulation steps
4. The final transfer function expression

The transfer function should be expressed in the s-domain (Laplace domain) showing the relationship between the output and input.
