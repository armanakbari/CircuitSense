# 🔧 Circuit Netlist Conversion: N-Node Removal

## **✅ Conversion Complete**

Successfully converted **50 circuits** from `datasets/mllm_benchmark_v12/symbolic_equations.json` to remove intermediate measurement nodes (N-prefixed) and create ordinary netlists that match circuit diagrams.

---

## **🎯 What Was Accomplished**

### **1. Problem Solved**
- **Original Issue**: Netlists contained intermediate measurement nodes like `N21`, `N42`, `N64` that don't appear in circuit diagrams
- **Measurement Pattern**: Components were split with 0V voltage sources for current measurement
  ```
  R2 2 N21 R2        # Component to intermediate node
  V_meas1 1 N21 0    # 0V measurement source
  ```

### **2. Conversion Logic**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identified measurement pairs (component + V_meas)
- **Circuit Reconstruction**: Merged components back to original connections
- **Measurement Removal**: Eliminated all V_meas and VI voltage sources
- **Connectivity Preservation**: Maintained circuit topology exactly

## **📊 Conversion Examples**

### **Example 1: Circuit 1_7**
**Before (with N-nodes):**
```spice
R2 2 N21 R2
V_meas1 1 N21 0
```

**After (ordinary netlist):**
```spice
R2 2 1 R2
```

### **Example 2: Circuit 1_50** 
**Before (with N-nodes):**
```spice
R3 4 N42 R3
V_meas1 2 N42 0
```

**After (ordinary netlist):**
```spice
R3 4 2 R3
```

## **📈 Usage Examples**

### **Before Conversion**
```spice
R4 0 1 R4
R2 2 N21 R2      ← Confusing intermediate node
V_meas1 1 N21 0  ← Measurement component
C1 2 3 C1
```

### **After Conversion**
```spice
R4 0 1 R4
R2 2 1 R2        ← Direct connection (matches diagram)
C1 2 3 C1        ← Clean, ordinary netlist
```
